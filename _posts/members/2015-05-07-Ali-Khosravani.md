Ali is a PhD student in Mechanical engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology. He earned two masters degrees, one in mechanical engineering at Brigham Young University in 2012 and another one in materials science at Sharif University of Technology in 2008. He accomplished three internships in General Motors R&D in 2011, 2012, and 2013. In addition, he is one of the two managers of MINED's experimental labs: MMCL (Mesoscale Microstructure Characterization lab) and TMMPL (Thermo-Mechanical Materials Processing Lab).
