Yuksel Yabansu is a PhD candidate in George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology. He earned his B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering and his M.S degree in Automotive Engineering at Istanbul Technical University. Yuksel focused largely on novel framework Materials Knowledge System (MKS) early in his PhD program and extended the framework for the elastic deformation of polycrystalline aggregates. His current research interest mainly lies in homogenization and localization in hierarchical multiscale modeling, machine learning in materials data classification and building processing-structure-property linkages.
