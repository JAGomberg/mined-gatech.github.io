David is a PhD student in the School of Computational Science and Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology. David earned a Masterâ€™s degree in experimental condensed matter physics at Brigham Young University where he fabricated and characterized thin-films and carbon nanotubes used in nanostructured high capacity battery electrodes and in X-ray windows. As an undergraduate, David studied theoretical physics and researched the evolution of chaotic systems using neural networks at Westminster College. He is a trainee in the NSF IGERT FLAMEL program, and one of the lead developers on PyMKS materials informatics toolkit.
